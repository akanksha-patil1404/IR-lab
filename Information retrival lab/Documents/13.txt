On Monday morning, when the world woke up to the news of Pakistan’s javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem winning a historic silver at the world championships in Budapest, Muhammad Ashraf was preparing to start his day as a mason in the town of Mian Channu in the country’s Khanewal district.

The father of seven lives with his family in a three-room abode in the town and everyone stayed up late to watch Nadeem compete in the final in the Worlds.

“Sade pind da ek ek banda Arshad nu TV te dekh raha si. Sareya nu pata si ki savere kam te jana hai par duniya de level te apne puttar nu medal jeetan da mauka kise kise nu milda hai (Our whole village was watching Arshad compete last night. Almost everybody knew that they had to go to work in the morning, including me, but I didn’t want to miss the chance to see my son win a medal at the world level),” Ashraf told The Indian Express on phone from Mian Channu.
