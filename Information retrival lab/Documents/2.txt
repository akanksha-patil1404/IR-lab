As Neeraj Chopra and Arshad Nadeem made track and field history by finishing one-two in the javelin throw at the World Championship, a new India-Pakistan sporting rivalry was born that lacks the edge of a cricket game between the two neighbours.

The morning the video of Chopra calling out his long-time friend from across the border Nadeem for a celebratory frame at the arena where they left the rest of the world behind went viral, the usual toxicity that follows a close cricket encounter between India and Pakistan was missing.

Nadeem’s coach and Pakistan’s five-time national javelin throw champion Syed Hussain Bukhari spoke about the power-shift in the sport with the emergence of the sub-continent as the new hub of world-class javelin throwers. India’s Kishore Jena finished fifth, followed by DP Manu.
