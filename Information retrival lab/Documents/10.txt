With versatile silhouettes, risque slits and lively hues, Malaika Arora is a trailblazer in the world of fashion. She is a true magician when it comes to effortlessly shifting between Western and ethnic silhouettes. We got to see that magic on the auspicious occasion of Onam when Malaika was seen leaving for her mother's home. For the occasion, the B-town diva chose to take the ethnic route. Malaika wore a white silk suit with an embellished mock neckline and scallop ends from the brand Faabiiana. Yellow tie and dye dupatta added contrast to her look. A sleek middle-parted low bun gave her the final touch. Don't miss her subtle black bindi.
