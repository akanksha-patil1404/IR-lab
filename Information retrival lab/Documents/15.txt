Residents in a Queensland neighbourhood, Australia, were gripped with fear as they recently spotted a huge python in their backyard. As the slithering animal was seen moving across the roof, it spooked locals in the area, who wondered how it got there in the first place.
Many people gathered outside to see the unusual sight; one person shot the entire incident on camera, and the video quickly garnered a lot of attention online.

In the video, a child is heard crying as the huge reptile turns its head towards the onlookers.
